> Enemy: How Imagine Dragons wrote Arcane’s opening song with two chords

Verse
========

I wake up to the sounds
of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around,
with my ear up to the ground
I’m searching to behold
the stories that are told
When my back is to the world,
that was smiling when I turned

The verse has a distinct rhythmic pattern comprising semiquavers, laid out in a descending melodic pattern. Each phrase takes on one of the two chords, and only uses two repeated notes that end on a minor 3rd.

In true Imagine Dragons fashion, the band also marked the end of each bar with rhyming words, punctuated with alliteration: Sounds, silence, allows. Run, around, ear, ground. To, stories, that, told.

Pre-chorus
Then comes a highly contrasting pre-chorus. Here, the rhythm slows, the words are dragged out, building up anticipation. In this transition, the bass guitar starts to make its presence heard.

Tell you you’re the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Four strong crochet beats are used in a descending melody to create an impact.

You also have to appreciate how “greatest” and “hate us” is an intentional partial rhyme, differing from the verse. This change is paired with a dissonant change at the end of the phrase, where a major 3rd, instead of minor, is deployed, which creates an unsettling feeling within the listener.

Chorus
========

Boom! The height of the Enemy is punctuated with a synthesized burst at the start and end of each phrase. And of course, another distinct rhythmic change.

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Look out for yourself
My enemy
Look out for yourself
But I’m ready

Alliteration is used throughout the opening song, but it is especially noticeable in the chorus because the same sound is repeated throughout: Misery, everybody, enemy, sympathy.

Energy is further built through the chorus’ rhythm and melody. After two downward patterns, the first melody goes up and down, followed by a line of quick semiquavers, almost like a trill.

Then, out of nowhere, the first triumphant upward major 6th interval (be, enemy).

Still, if you were hoping for a resolution, I’m afraid there’s none because this opening song never actually plays its root B minor chord. The chorus ends with a shoutout (look out for yourself), and a descending low octave “enemy-y-y-y” mimicking the pre-chorus.
